<h1>LeaflEat</h1>
<p>This is a test website to demonstrate the functionality of LeaflEat.</p>
<p>As restaurants introduced customers back to eat, paper menus disappeared in place of QR codes.</p>
<p>To take advantage of this trend, my idea is to inject an ad into this user journey of scanning the QR code then viewing the menu,</p>
<p>This is a B2B model where if an ad generates $1 in revenue, we (LeaflEat) keep $0.80 and give the restaurant $0.20 or something like that.</p>
<p>My rationale. Yes people hate ads BUT I believe that people are desensitized to seeing them. Moreover, displaying an ad barely interripts the user experience.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>You will be automatically redirected to your menu in 5 seconds...</strong></p>
